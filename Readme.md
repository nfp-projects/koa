## Koa-lite

  This is a tiny (improved) fork of [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa) that is almost 80% smaller in disc space and uses a lot less dependancies, a total of 4 packages compared to Koa's 42 package installation. It also uses some improved versions to some of the previous dependencies. Overall the whole installation can be expected to go from 807KB to around 160KB.
# Attention

Due to many of the fallbacks and issues on how github is being managed, all code and repository has been moved over to https://git.nfp.is/TheThing/koa-lite
